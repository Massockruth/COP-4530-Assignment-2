Analysis of Worst-Case Run-Time Complexities

1. reverse() Function:
   - Complexity: O(N)
   - Explanation: The function traverses the entire list once and performs constant-time operations for each node, 
resulting in a linear time complexity proportional to the number of elements in the list.

2. remove_if() Function:
   - Complexity: O(N)
   - Explanation: The function traverses the entire list once, evaluating a predicate condition and potentially removing nodes for each element.
 The operations are assumed to be constant-time, resulting in a linear time complexity proportional to the number of elements in the list.
